                        <p>Filipino cuisine is composed of the cuisines of more than a hundred distinct ethnolinguistic groups found
                            throughout the Philippine archipelago. A majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino
                            cuisine are from the food traditions of various ethnolinguistic groups and tribes of the archipelago,
                            including the Ilocano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Tagalog, Bicolano, Visayan, Chavacano and Maranao
                            ethnolinguistic groups. The dishes associated with these groups evolved over the centuries from a
                            largely indigenous (largely Austronesian) base shared with maritime Southeast Asia with varied
                            influences from Chinese, Spanish and American cuisines, in line with the major waves of influence
                            that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago and adapted using indigenous ingredients to meet
                            local preferences.[1]</p>

                            Dishes range from the very simple meal of fried salted fish and rice to curries, paellas, and cozidos
                            of Iberian origin made for fiestas. Popular dishes include lechón[2] (whole roasted pig), longganisa

                            kaldereta (meat stewed in tomato sauce and liver paste), mechado (larded beef in soy and tomato sauce),
                            pochero (beef and bananas in tomato sauce), afritada (chicken or beef and vegetables simmered in tomato
                            sauce), kare-kare (oxtail and vegetables cooked in peanut sauce), pinakbet (kabocha squash, eggplant,
                            beans, okra, bitter melon, and tomato stew flavored with shrimp paste), sinigang (meat or seafood with
                            vegetables in sour broth), pancit (noodles), and lumpia (fresh or fried spring rolls).

                            Historical Overview of the Philippines <br>
                            In the past, the Negritos, the original inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago, lived as
                            nomadic hunter-gatherers, sustaining themselves on wild tubers, seafood, and game meat. <br><br>

                            Approximately 6000 years ago, Austronesians, skilled seafarers, embarked on migrations that greatly
                            influenced the region. Many present-day Filipinos are descendants of these Austronesians, bringing with
                            them advancements in aquaculture, agriculture, and the domestication of various foodstuffs and animals. <br><br>

                            The plains of central and southwestern Luzon, the Bicol peninsula, and eastern Panay played pivotal
                            roles as major rice producers. Surplus rice was distributed across the archipelago, symbolizing wealth.
                             Additionally, rice-based delicacies held significance as ceremonial offerings in important events.

                            Pre-Colonial Culinary Influences in the Philippines <br><br>

                            During the pre-colonial period, the Philippines experienced significant cultural and culinary 
                            influences that shaped its unique cuisine. While later colonial periods left lasting imprints, 
                            it is crucial to acknowledge the impact of pre-Spanish influences from neighboring countries and 
                            the indigenous origins of Filipino culinary traditions. <br><br>

                            1. Trade with China: Before Spanish colonization, the Philippines engaged in extensive trade with China. 
                            Chinese merchants established outposts in coastal cities, introducing essential elements to Filipino 
                            cuisine such as rice noodles, a key ingredient in pancit, and the Filipino version of eggrolls known as 
                            lumpia [[6](source)][[7](source)][[8](source)][[9](source)]. <br><br>

                            2. Rice Cultivation: A pivotal moment in Filipino cuisine was the initiation of rice cultivation. 
                            In Northern Luzon, the Ifugao people crafted the renowned Banaue rice terraces over 2,000 years 
                            ago. Using rudimentary tools, they ingeniously shaped terraces on steep mountain slopes, enabling 
                            highland rice cultivation. Rice, a staple in Filipino cuisine, exhibits diverse regional influences, 
                            as seen in dishes like arroz caldo, reminiscent of Chinese congee [[10](source)][[11](source)].

                            Culinary Impact of Spanish Colonial Rule <br>
                            During the Spanish colonial period, significant transformations occurred in the culinary landscape 
                            of the Philippine archipelago, shaped by the establishment of the Manila galleon trade network and 
                            domestic agricultural reforms. <br><br>

                            Galleon Trade Influences: <br><br>

                            The Manila-Acapulco galleon exchange, connecting the Philippines with mainland New Spain 
                            (present-day Mexico), introduced two major culinary influences: Chinese and Mexican. <br>
                            Mexican cuisine brought a diverse array of New World and Spanish ingredients and techniques, 
                            including maize, chili peppers, bell peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts, chocolate, pineapples, 
                            coffee beans, jicama, various squashes, annatto, and avocados. <br>
                            Mexicans and other Latin Americans brought Spanish cooking techniques, leading to the adoption of 
                            practices such as sofrito, sausage making (longganisa, resembling chorizos), bread baking, and the 
                            creation of local adaptations like empanadas, paellas, tortas, and tamales. <br><br>


                            Filipino Culinary Influence Beyond Borders: <br>

                            Migrating Filipinos extended their culinary legacy to the Americas and Pacific islands under Spanish 
                            rule, such as Guam and the Marianas.
                            Filipino staples like rice, sugarcane, coconuts, citruses, mangoes, and tamarind became integrated 
                            into the local cuisines of these regions.
                            Filipino influence is notably present in the west coast of Guerrero in Mexican cuisine, featuring 
                            practices like tuba winemaking, guinatan coconut milk-based dishes, and potentially ceviche.
                            In Guam, Filipino dishes like pancit and lumpia gained popularity, while local adaptations such as 
                            kelaguen and kalamai emerged from Filipino culinary predecessors (kilawin and kalamay, respectively).

                            The Era of American Colonization <br>
                            Following their victory in the Spanish–American War in 1898, the United States acquired the Philippines 
                            from Spain for $20 million in the Treaty of Paris.[12] This marked the beginning of the American colonial 
                            period, which persisted until 1946. During this time, Americans introduced Filipinos to a range of fast 
                            foods, encompassing hot dogs, hamburgers, fried chicken, and ice cream. Additionally, they brought in 
                            convenient food items like Spam, corned beef, instant coffee, and evaporated milk. Notably, Spam has 
                            become a staple breakfast item in contemporary Filipino cuisine, frequently enjoyed alongside garlic 
                            fried rice.

                            Contemporary Evolution of Filipino Cuisine <br>
                            In the present era, Filipino culinary traditions are in a state of continual evolution, 
                            embracing new cooking techniques, diverse styles, and an array of ingredients.[13] The culinary 
                            landscape features a blend of traditional dishes, ranging from the simple to the elaborate, 
                            incorporating both indigenous and foreign influences. Concurrently, there is a growing popularity 
                            of international dishes and fast food offerings within the Filipino culinary scene. It is noteworthy, 
                            however, that the Filipino diet tends to have higher levels of total fat, saturated fat, and 
                            cholesterol compared to other Asian diets.[14] <br><br>

                            Recognizing the importance of safeguarding the Filipino people's diet and health, President Noynoy 
                            Aquino enacted Republic Act No. 10611, also known as the Food Safety Act, in 2013. This legislation 
                            aims to establish protective measures concerning food quality and consumption.[15] In 2022, TasteAtlas 
                            acknowledged the global standing of Filipino cuisine, ranking it as the 23rd best in the world. Notably, 
                            specific Filipino dishes such as chicken inasal and sisig were also recognized among the best globally.[16]

                            Characteristics of Filipino Cuisine <br>
                            Flavor Combination: <br><br>

                            Filipino cuisine is characterized by a harmonious blend of sweet (tamis), sour (asim), and salty (alat) flavors.[2] <br>
                            In specific regions like Bicol, the Cordilleras, and among Muslim Filipinos, spicy (anghang) is a 
                            fundamental element in cooking. <br><br>
                            
                            Counterpoint Feature: <br><br>

                            A distinctive aspect of Filipino cuisine is the counterpoint, where sweet and salty elements are paired together. <br>
                            Examples include champorado (sweet cocoa rice porridge) paired with tuyo (salted, sun-dried fish). <br>
                            Dinuguan (savory stew of pig's blood and innards) is paired with puto (sweet, steamed rice cakes). <br>
                            Unripe fruits like green mangoes, slightly sweet yet very sour, are enjoyed dipped in salt or bagoong. <br>
                            The use of cheese, offering a salty-sweet taste, is prevalent in sweetcakes like bibingka and puto, as well 
                            as in ice cream flavoring. <br>
                            These distinctive characteristics contribute to the rich and diverse flavor profile that defines Filipino culinary traditions.

                            The Philippines is the exclusive exporter of edible varieties of Pili Nuts. These nuts are often 
                            consumed as a snack (merienda) or incorporated into desserts, providing a delightful milky texture 
                            as they melt in the mouth. <br>
                            Vinegar: <br><br>

                            Vinegar is a staple in Filipino cuisine, used in various dishes. Notably, Adobo, a popular Filipino 
                            dish, relies on vinegar not only for simplicity and ease of preparation but also for its preserving 
                            qualities. Adobo can be stored for days, and its flavor often improves with time. <br>
                            Smoked and Sun-Dried Fish: <br><br>

                            Tinapa is a smoke-cured fish, while tuyo, daing, and dangit are corned, sun-dried fish. These items 
                            are favored for their extended shelf life, lasting for weeks without spoiling, even in the absence 
                            of refrigeration. <br>
                            These native ingredients showcase the diverse and unique flavors that characterize Filipino culinary traditions.

                            Cooking, Serving, and Consumption in Filipino Culture <br>
                            Filipino cooking and dining traditions are deeply rooted in informality and communal gatherings, 
                            often centered around the family kitchen. Unlike Western dining customs, Filipino meals are typically 
                            served all at once rather than in courses. <br><br>

                            Eating Practices: <br><br>

                            Filipinos traditionally do not use chopsticks; instead, the customary way of eating is with hands, 
                            particularly for dry dishes like inihaw or prito. This practice, known as "kamayan," involves 
                            using the washed left hand for picking up centralized food and the right hand for bringing it to 
                            the mouth. While less common in urban areas, the spirit of kamayan is felt during nature outings, 
                            beach vacations, and town fiestas. <br><br>
                            Utensils Influence: <br><br>

                            Influenced by the Spanish occupation, Filipinos adopted the use of paired utensils, namely the 
                            spoon and fork. The use of knives was restricted by Spain. Filipinos ingeniously use the side of 
                            the spoon to "cut" their food. While Western flatware is commonly used, the primary utensil pairing 
                            at Filipino dining tables remains the spoon and fork, not the knife and fork. <br><br>
                            Boodle Fight Concept: <br><br>

                            The "boodle fight" concept, popularized by the Philippine Army, involves spreading banana leaves 
                            on the table as the main serving platter. Portions of rice and various Filipino dishes are laid 
                            out for communal feasting. Despite this informal setting, the use of spoons and forks remains the norm. <br>
                            These cultural practices highlight the significance of shared meals, the influence of historical 
                            periods on dining habits, and the preservation of traditional ways even in modern settings.

                            Filipino Fiesta Food <br>
                            Filipino fiestas are marked by elaborate and labor-intensive dishes that bring communities together. 
                            The centerpiece of these celebrations is often lechon, a whole roasted pig, though suckling pigs 
                            (lechonillo or lechon de leche) or cattle calves (lechong baka) can also grace the table. Served 
                            with lechon sauce made from the roasted pig's liver, it's a festive delicacy. Other dishes include 
                            hamonado, relleno, mechado, afritada, caldereta, puchero, paella, menudo, morcon, embutido, suman, 
                            and pancit canton. <br><br>

                            On Christmas Eve, known as Noche Buena, the star of the table is the Christmas ham and Edam cheese 
                            (queso de bola). Supermarkets are filled with these treats during the Christmas season. Additionally, 
                            bibingka and puto bumbong, steamed purple sticky rice in bamboo tubes, are popular seasonal delights. <br><br>

                            Sweets and pastries like leche flan, ube, sapin-sapin, sorbetes, totong or sinukmani, ginataan, and 
                            gulaman add a sweet touch to the festivities. Lumpiang sariwa, a fresh spring roll with a soft crepe 
                            filled with various ingredients, and ukoy, shredded papaya and small shrimp fried into patties, are 
                            common at celebrations. Lumpiang sariwa has Chinese origins, derived from popiah. <br> <br>

                            Filipino fiesta tables showcase a rich array of flavors, embodying the spirit of communal joy and culinary mastery.
